{"data":{"allTseProjects":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Center for Community Health Website","description":"The Center for Community Health is an organization working to improve access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food through their Live Well Community Market Program. They are currently doing this by assessing markets through a paper form and then calculating a level for each market by hand. Markets that provide healthier options have higher scores than those with lower markets. CCH then gives rewards to markets who are doing well (have a higher level) in order to incentivize markets with lower levels to provide healthier options to their community. Because the surveys are taken on paper and the calculations are done by hand, the process is tedious and prone to error. Our team is building and online market assessment tool so that the process is more efficient and accurate. After filling out the online form, users will be able to have immediate access to the level of the market. Users will also be able to visualize data of markets that have already been assessed with graphs and pie charts. This will help CCH analyze what areas of San Diego have healthier markets, so that they can easily see what areas need more development when working on improving access to healthy and affordable food.","ongoing":true,"image":"https://research.rabobank.com/far/en/images/Sector-freshproduce1920.jpg","local_image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.8768328445747802,"src":"/static/564c5a5ba5bd23ea4b5c05fc96ec36c8/1a92f/Sector-freshproduce1920.jpg","srcSet":"/static/564c5a5ba5bd23ea4b5c05fc96ec36c8/788f9/Sector-freshproduce1920.jpg 250w,\n/static/564c5a5ba5bd23ea4b5c05fc96ec36c8/06f71/Sector-freshproduce1920.jpg 500w,\n/static/564c5a5ba5bd23ea4b5c05fc96ec36c8/1a92f/Sector-freshproduce1920.jpg 1000w,\n/static/564c5a5ba5bd23ea4b5c05fc96ec36c8/686ef/Sector-freshproduce1920.jpg 1500w,\n/static/564c5a5ba5bd23ea4b5c05fc96ec36c8/cd09d/Sector-freshproduce1920.jpg 1920w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}},{"node":{"name":"Symphonic Student Association Website","description":"The Symphonic Student Association is a student run organization committed to foster a community for those who share an interest in instrumental music.

The portal will also display a list of all the relevant items matching the filter in the form of clickable image boxes, which redirect the user to the corresponding website.
