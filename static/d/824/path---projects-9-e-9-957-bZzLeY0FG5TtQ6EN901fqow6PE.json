SSA is a new organization, and they commissioned us to design and develop a website for them. A designer and multiple developers have been working together to create a website for SSA using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The team has worked closely with the president to develop each page according to the needs of the organization.","ongoing":true,"image":"https://mcarmenfer.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/formas-instrumentales.gif","local_image":{"childImageSharp":null}}},{"node":{"name":"Center for Community Health Website","description":"The Center for Community Health is an organization working to improve access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food through their Live Well Community Market Program. They are currently doing this by assessing markets through a paper form and then calculating a level for each market by hand. Markets that provide healthier options have higher scores than those with lower markets. CCH then gives rewards to markets who are doing well (have a higher level) in order to incentivize markets with lower levels to provide healthier options to their community. Because the surveys are taken on paper and the calculations are done by hand, the process is tedious and prone to error. Our team is building and online market assessment tool so that the process is more efficient and accurate. After filling out the online form, users will be able to have immediate access to the level of the market. Users will also be able to visualize data of markets that have already been assessed with graphs and pie charts. This will help CCH analyze what areas of San Diego have healthier markets, so that they can easily see what areas need more development when working on improving access to healthy and affordable food.","ongoing":true,"image":"https://ucsdcommunityhealth.org/wp-content/themes/cch/assets/images/logo@2x.png","local_image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAECAYAAACOXx+WAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAx0lEQVQY012PywrCMBBFU+xKpFoF8QWi1AeID9BCbYi6URQX4s6VYKuiH+J31zOYlYHDnUxubjJK69TTOqlDlbqgWKjUpdf7o4Lg7GRZ5hrzKMVx4ksfRMvggvgdi1KYBoQd2AxhBxFs4zg9occoum0I9Nbr5xDvip4wtT5P/S8uNq1hxoUuOgcNI9EwvLYILBLY4zykJyx+mixtHXG2h4l8Nw8Vgmu/8dMKNOxI/nh8yRGYM+aOJwnodUBUHu8TKh9qg0xa/QIKMVHKYwQHhAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","aspectRatio":4.895833333333333,"src":"/static/6391d3e3f5727610759075a32bdf7114/c4e1f/logo%402x.png","srcSet":"/static/6391d3e3f5727610759075a32bdf7114/4cf26/logo%402x.png 250w,\n/static/6391d3e3f5727610759075a32bdf7114/b2fcd/logo%402x.png 500w,\n/static/6391d3e3f5727610759075a32bdf7114/c4e1f/logo%402x.png 940w","sizes":"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"}}}}},{"node":{"name":"Office of Innovation and Commercialization Website","description":"UCSD OIC’s website did not have a feature/page that would point visitors to their desired campus resource, or that would point them to locations where more resources were in demand. This project consists of the creation of a portal for the client where the customers can identify themselves as one of three available options (Friends & Alumni, Faculty, Students) and consequently filter the resources offered at the university through the selection of themes and areas of interest. The portal will also display a list of all the relevant items matching the filter in the form of clickable image boxes, which redirect the user to the corresponding website. The portal was inspired by MIT’s own resources portal found at https://innovation.mit.edu/resources/.
