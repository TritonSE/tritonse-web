  "overview": "The Symphonic Student Association is a student run organization committed to foster a community for those who share an interest in instrumental music. SSA is a new organization, and they commissioned us to design and develop a website for them. A designer and multiple developers worked together to create a website for SSA using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The team has worked closely with the president of SSA to develop each page according to the needs of the organization. The end result: a descriptive website which displays information about the organization, current members, dynamic calendar of events, collaborations, and instructions on how to support the organization.<br/><br/>The website is live at <a href=\"https://ssa.ucsd.edu/\" class=\"blue-text text-darken-3 tse-project-link-blue\">http://ssa.ucsd.edu/</a>.",
