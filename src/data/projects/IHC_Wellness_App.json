  "overview": "IHCWellness is a native iOS & Android application that encourages you to perform daily check-ins, log your mood and record your current activities. By answering a short series of questions daily and doing recommended activities (tailored by the International Health Collective), users earn points that they can spend on purchasing materials to grow a plant. For UCSD students, there is also a calendar of campus wellness events that can be attended for additional points. All of this can be done through the application.",
