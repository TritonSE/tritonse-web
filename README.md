# TSE Website 

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/TritonSE/tritonse.github.io/tree/source.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/TritonSE/tritonse.github.io/tree/source)

This repository contains both:
  1. The source code used to build our website 
  2. The results of the build process in a separate branch

## Infrastructure 

We built our site with GatsbyJS, a static site generator that uses React 
to compile data from external sources into static HTML files. Data is stored 
in a Firebase database, which is queried during the build process. Travis CI 
is used for testing and deployment purposes, such that commits to `source` 
are automatically reflected on to our website. You can find autogenerated 
builds in the `master` branch.

## Node Setup

Ensure that you have Node 12+ on your machine. Earlier Node versions may
work but are unsupported. Next, install the Gatsby CLI toolkit globally
in order to be able to run `gatsby` commands.

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli 
```

Clone this repository into the directory of your choice and `cd` in.
Then, perform local installation procedures (e.g. install Node dependencies).

```
npm install 
```

Finally, using Gatsby's CLI commands, build our files and run a development server.

```
gatsby develop
```

## Docker Setup

Assuming you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system, you can 
use:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
